    <h1>Amy Winehouse</h1>
 
        <p>Amy Jade Winehouse <em>(14 September 1983 – 23 July 2011)</em> was an English singer and songwriter. Amy Winehouse biography is a glimpse into the short and controversial life of Amy Jade Winehouse.She was born to a jewish family on 14th September, 1983 in the <b>Southgate area of North London.</b></p>

        <p>Amy was the youngest child of Janis Winehouse (Seaton) a pharmacist and her father Mitchell Winehouse a taxi driver. Amy’s only brother Alex is four years older than Amy.</p>

        <p>Amy Winehouse is known for her powerful, deep soulful vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres including R&B, soul and jazz.</p> 
        
        <p>The young singer's life took a turn over time with the weight of fame, and she began to struggle with bulemia, drugs and drinking. She didn't want to get treament because she did not feel like she was "some messed up person. Less than five years after “Rehab” was released, Amy died of alcohol poisoning.</p>
    
        <p>Her lyrics spoke to many people, and even though her life ended in a very tradgic Hollywood way, her music lives on. I will always remember her and keep her as one of my top singer-songwriter idols, I just adore her and feel so strongly about ovredosing and drug and alcohol abuse in the industry. Hopefully she serves as a lesson to others and shedshelps them to feel realize life is short and very precious.</p></section>
